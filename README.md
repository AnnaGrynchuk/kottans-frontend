It was interesting and useful course for me about Git and Git Hub. It shows visually what probable problems could you have if you write incorrect command. Also I've known some new commands, which can be very helpful on real project: cherry-pick and rebase.

In this course I've learnt how to use nano editor, it was really new for me. Also I  have detailed knowledge of HTTP request and response headers, identification, authentication and caching.
